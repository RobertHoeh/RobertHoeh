# Robert Hoeh
Hello, I am currently attending KSU working on my Bachelor's of Science in Software Engineering

I was also one of the main contributors of [wecan2](https://github.com/WheelerCodingClub/wecan2), the Wheeler Coding Club group project.

I also helped develop an inventory management system for Gimme That Sugar. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it working due to technical issues with the vending machines, but nonetheless, helped establish a code base for doing this. I also wrote research on this! You can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sbDn7KhpjqL-S-wqch5qRLANDSX3P7v7_1EjNvIafEA/edit?usp=sharing).
